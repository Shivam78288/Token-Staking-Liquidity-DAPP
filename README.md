Token-Staking-Liquidity-DAPP
----------------------------

Person can send ether to Reserve Contract which allots the sender equivalent amount of Mindpay tokens but locks it inside the contract for a specific period of time. 10% of the ether is sent to Liquidity contract instantly. After the lock period is over, person can either cancel investment or stake it. If the person cancels the investment, his Mindpay token allotment is burnt and 90% of Ether sent by him is refunded. If he has staked the investment, he can withdraw the tokens from the contract at anytime after it.
